Change the Sequence Setup 
-------------------------

Currently there is a little bit of magic going on when setting up sequences...

- name: foo
  type: Sequence(String())

Which was nice until we realised that you couldn't apply a widget separately to
the Sequence and the String. The syntax for a sequence of sequences of strings
should change to ..

- name: foo
  type: Sequence()
  widget:
    type: CustomSequenceWidget()
  attr:
    type: Sequence()
    attr:
        type: String()

- name: foo.*.*
  widget:
    type: CustomStringItemWidget()


Removing the parenthes?
-----------------------

I think the parenthese might be removable after the "Change the Sequence Setup"
is fixed. The 'type' used to try to look like the Python code but that turned
out to be wrong; after the change 'type' becomes just the name of the factory
(class name, typically) to call.

- name: foo
  type: Sequence
  widget:
    type: CustomSequenceWidget
  attr:
    type: Sequence
    attr:
        type: String

- name: foo.*.*
  widget:
    type: CustomStringItemWidget
