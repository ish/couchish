Change the Sequence Setup 
-------------------------

Currently there is a little bit of magic going on when setting up sequences...

- name: foo
  type: Sequence(String())

Which was nice until we realised that you couldn't apply a widget separately to
the Sequence and the String.. The syntax should change to ..

- name: foo
  type: Sequence()

- name: foo.*
  tyoe: String()
